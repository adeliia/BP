def graph_log_likelihood(batch_adj, wys_output):
    """
    Computes the graph log likelihood loss function as in https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09599.

    This is different to most keras loss functions in that it doesn't directly compare predicted values to expected
    values. It uses `wys_output` which contains the dot products of embeddings and expected random walks,
    and part of the adjacency matrix `batch_adj` to calculate how well the node embeddings capture the graph
    structure in some sense.

    Args:
        batch_adj: tensor with shape ``batch_rows x 1 x num_nodes`` containing rows of the adjacency matrix
        wys_output: tensor with shape ``batch_rows x 2 x num_nodes`` containing the embedding outer product
            scores with shape ``batch_rows x 1 x num_nodes`` and attentive expected random walk
            with shape ``batch_rows x 1, num_nodes`` concatenated.
    Returns:
        the graph log likelihood loss for the batch
