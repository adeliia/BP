    A data generator for use with graph classification algorithms.

    The supplied graphs should be :class:`StellarGraph` objects with node features.
    Use the :meth:`flow` method supplying the graph indexes and (optionally) targets
    to get an object that can be used as a Keras data generator.

    This generator supplies the features arrays and the adjacency matrices to a mini-batch Keras
    graph classification model. Differences in the number of nodes are resolved by padding each
    batch of features and adjacency matrices, and supplying a boolean mask indicating which are
    valid and which are padding.
