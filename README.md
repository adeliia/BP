## Heuristics in Graph Data Mining via Node Embeddings

Notebooks and source code of the bachelor's degree project of Gataullina Adeliia. 

## Abstract

This paper considers the usage of heuristic algorithms in data mining
tasks on graphs. One of the ways how to work with graphs is to
represent them in the form of vectors, i.e. embeddings. Algorithms
node2vec and word2vec creates such embeddings. The optimisation
of those algorithms involves searching for proper settings of their
parameters. Heuristics may facilitate that searching. This work aims
to show the usage of the node2vec algorithm for solving of the cluster
analysis task on graphs and verify if heuristics are suitable for
the optimisation of the node2vec model.
